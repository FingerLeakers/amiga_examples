===============

The main theme of this demo is trackloading data whilst the application is running.

We cram a DD floppy full of image and music data, then load and display each image in turn whilst playing a P61 module.

There are quite a few new things in here:

  * We use a [modified bootloader](alpine_bootloader.s) that reads the size of the main program from the disk before trackloading it.
  * Photon's trackloader is also now copied into the main program so it can be used to load subsequent data.
  * We use multiple sections and a [linker script](link.script) to help with organising data on the ADF image. The linker script is not technically required, however I wanted to see what I could do with vlink and linker scripts.
  * We switched to the [doynamite68k](https://github.com/AxisOxy/Planet-Rocklobster/tree/master/tools/doynamite68k) compressor/decompressor. The compressed file are larger than those generated by Shinkler, however the decompressor is a lot faster.
  * P61 is configured to use CIA mode.
