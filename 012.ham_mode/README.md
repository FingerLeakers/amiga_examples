Hold and Modify Mode
====================

I added basic supprt to [imagecon](../tools/imagecon) to output HAM mode data.  The algorithm used is pretty simple so the quality of the HAM display could definately be improved.

We can see definite improvement between 32 colors and my HAM generation, but my guess it that it could be a lot better.
